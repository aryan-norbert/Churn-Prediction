# Earthquake Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes global earthquake data obtained from the US Geological Survey (USGS) using data visualization techniques to gain insights into seismic activity patterns.

### Methodology:
1. **Data Visualization**: The project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for visualizing earthquake occurrences. Visualizations include time series plots of earthquake frequency, geographical maps pinpointing epicenters, and statistical charts (e.g., histograms, box plots) to analyze earthquake magnitude distributions.

2. **Insights Generation**: Analysis involves identifying regions prone to seismic activity, correlating earthquake magnitude with geographical features, and detecting temporal patterns in earthquake occurrence.

### Libraries Used:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib: Basic plotting and visualization.
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
- Plotly: Interactive visualization for maps and charts.
